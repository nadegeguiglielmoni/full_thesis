\chapter{Hi-C scaffolding of the bdelloid rotifer \textit{Adineta vaga}}

Bdelloid rotifers have been drawing interest due to their suspected unusual ancient asexuality. A first diploid assembly of \textit{Adineta vaga} was published in 2013 \cite{flot2013}, with a total length of 218 Mb and a N50 of 260 kb. The genome was described at the time as "incompatible with conventional meiosis", for the surprising non-colinear structure of homologous sequences. In the following paper, the genome of \textit{Adineta vaga} was assembled \textit{de novo} using PacBio CLR, Nanopore, Illumina and Hi-C reads. Three assemblies were produced: a collapsed haploid assembly using all types of reads; and two diploid assemblies, one using PacBio CLR obtained with FALCON and FALCON-Unzip, and the second one using Illumina reads with Bwise. All these assemblies were scaffolded using Hi-C by the program instaGRAAL \cite{instagraal}, and converged to 6 haploid chromosomes (collapsed assembly) or 12 phased chromosomes (FALCON-Unzip and Bwise assemblies). These results show that the genome of \textit{Adineta vaga} is: diploid, with 6 pairs of chromosomes; a paleotetraploid, as it has homoeologous, colinear chromosomes (pairs 1, 2 and 3 are homoeologous to pairs 4, 5, 6 respectively); and thus compatible with meiosis. \\
I contributed to this study in the assembly and Hi-C scaffolding of the collapsed haploid assembly. \\
